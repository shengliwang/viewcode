This is my first to upload code to gitHub. I am very exciting.
Compile this source code, you will get the program name viewcode.
Then, you can move this viewcode program to your PATH environments.
Use this program you can see something like as follows:

index	:int	,char
1	    :102	,f
2	    :114	,r
3	    :111	,o
4	    :109	,m
5	    :32	,

7	    :122	,z
8	    :95	  ,_
